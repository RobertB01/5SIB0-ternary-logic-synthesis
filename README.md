The MATLAB algorithms in this folder are used to optimize ternary logic using 3 different techniques.
An explanation of the algorithms is given in the corresponding paper.

The main file is "Ternary_logic_synthesis.m". This file can be used to run all 3 algorithms.
The output of the algorithms for a single gate can be found by selecting an input gate (options are given in the script),
and subsequently running the section of the desired optimization technique. 
For the Quine-McCluskey algorithm, the choice can be made whether to include the extra optimization steps, as explained in the paper.

A complex gate can be simulated and directly compared in the corresponding section of the main file.
